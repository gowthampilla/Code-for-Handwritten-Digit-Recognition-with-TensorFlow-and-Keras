Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNNs
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and achieves high accuracy on the dataset, making it a great example of image classification with deep learning.

Project Overview
The primary goal is to develop a CNN model that can accurately identify digits (0-9) from images of handwritten characters. The MNIST dataset is a standard dataset in machine learning, containing grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image has a resolution of 28x28 pixels and is labeled with the corresponding digit.

Features of This Project
Data Preprocessing:

Load the MNIST dataset directly from Keras.
Normalize pixel values to improve model performance.
Reshape images for CNN compatibility.
Model Architecture:

The CNN model consists of Conv2D layers for feature extraction, MaxPooling2D layers for downsampling, and Dense layers for classification.
Uses ReLU activations for hidden layers and softmax activation for the output layer to handle multi-class classification.
Training and Evaluation:

Trains the model on 60,000 images from the training set and validates performance on 10,000 images from the test set.
Measures performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
Prediction:

After training, the model is used to predict the digit in new or unseen images.
Example images with predicted labels are displayed to verify the model's performance visually.
Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in image processing and machine learning. It includes:

Training Set: 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
Test Set: 10,000 images for evaluating model performance.
Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, flattened to a single-channel array.

Code Walkthrough
Data Preprocessing: Loads and normalizes MNIST data, reshapes it for CNN input.
Model Definition: Defines the CNN architecture with Conv2D and Dense layers.
Model Training: Compiles and trains the model with categorical_crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
Evaluation and Visualization: Evaluates model performance and displays sample predictions.
Results and Insights
The trained CNN model achieves high accuracy (98-99%) on the test set, making it effective at classifying handwritten digits. The top features influencing classification are the shapes and strokes of each digit.

Potential Improvements
Model Tuning: Experiment with more layers or larger filters to potentially improve accuracy.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Use techniques like grid search or random search to tune hyperparameters.
Custom Digits: Test the model with images of handwritten digits created by users to test its generalization.
Example Prediction
Here is an example of using the model to predict a single image from the test set:

python
Copy code
# Make a prediction on a test image
sample_image = X_test[0].reshape(1, 28, 28, 1)
predicted_class = np.argmax(model.predict(sample_image))

plt.imshow(X_test[0].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')
plt.title(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
plt.show()
Conclusion
